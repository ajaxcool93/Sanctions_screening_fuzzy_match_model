# Sanctions_screening_fuzzy_match_model
This was a intresting project. This mini-project simulates a name screening engine for detecting potential sanctions hits. It demonstrates fuzzy matching techniques using Python, aligned with industry practices for financial crime risk management.
## Overview
- Uses token-based fuzzy matching (RapidFuzz) to detect similar names.
- Compares input names (e.g., customer names data from kaggle dataset) against a sanctions list(OFAC SDN).
- Outputs match scores and potential hits.
